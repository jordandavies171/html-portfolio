<h1>Jordan and Suze's Favourite Films</h1>
<h2>The best films that we can remember seeing!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>This was a great film, very fast paced though and a bit too long tbh. Also the nuke didn't deafen us. 9/10.</p>
<h3>2. Creed III</h3>
<p>I barely remember this film because it was so long ago but I'm pretty sure it was good. Didn't have Rocky in it though which was a shame. 8/10.</p>
<h3>3. Snowden</h3>
<p>This was a biopic. Again I can't really remember it too well but it was decent and interesting. 7/10.</p>
